# Assignment 4 - All About Recursion

This assignment tasked students with creating a total of 8 functions. In Part I, 4 recursive functions had to be implemented, given the function name and definition. 
In Part II, 2 recursive functions with implementations were given, but were inefficient due to calling the functions on the same values over and over. The task here was to make them more efficient through variable storage.
Finally, for Part III, 2 recursive functions were given which needed to have equivalent iterative functions created.
