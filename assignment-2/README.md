# Assignment 2 - Unit Testing

This assignment was designed to teach us about unit testing. The `pytest` module was used for testing in this case, instead of the Python built-in `unittest` module, as that was the Prof's preference. In reality, `unittest` is preferred.

## About the Python files

There are a total of 5 files in the folder. `run_pytest.py` can be used to run all the tests from the various files quickly an easily.

Then there are 3 files which contain functions that were given to us, and a suite of unit tests that I wrote. This is the first part of the assignment, and the task was just to write tests for given functions. This includes `binary_string_test.py`, `independent_test.py`, and `primes_up_to_n_test.py`.

Finally, for part two of the assignment, we had to write a function called `all_odd_or_even` that returns true if all passed integers are even or odd, and false if they are mixed or not integers. Then, unit tests had to be created for this function as well. This final part of the assignment is in `PT2_self_written_test.py`.
