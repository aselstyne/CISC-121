# CISC-121
All the assignments I completed in CISC-121 (Intro to Computer Science I) course at Queen's University in Fall 2021.

# About CISC-121

As the name suggests, this is an introductory course in computer science. It's meant to be a follow up course to CISC-101, Elements Of Computer Science, although I skipped that course as I already had Python experience.

The course is focussed on Python script development. The assignments cover unit testing, Pydoc for documentation, file I/O, program complexity, k-means clustering, and an intro to objects and OOP.

I received a 100% on each of these assignments, and ended the course with an A+.
