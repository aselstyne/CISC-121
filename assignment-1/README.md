# Assignment 1 - Vigenère Cipher

The task for this assignment was to implement the [Vigenère cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher#Description) in Python. The program presented here will prompt the user for some text, and then ask for a keyword which is used to encrypt the first piece of text.

Although it is a fairly simple assignment, it was supposed to ensure that everyone one in the class was comfortable with Python programming. It was also an introduction to PEP8 code style, which was used for the remaining assignments in the course.
