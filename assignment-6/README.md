# Assignment 6 - Predator and Prey

This assignment had us model the relationship between hyena and sheep populations over time, using the [Lotka-Volterra predator-prey equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations). Given was two sets of modelling constants, and the task was to implement a function that can run the equations, and then use the `matplotlib` library to plot the functions over time. The images of the two plots were submitted along with the code. The conclusion of the assignment was that the first set of values were stable, while the second were not. 

Running the Python script will generate the two plots, if `matplotlib` is installed.
