# Assignment 7 - K-Means Clustering

Assignment 7 was designed to teach students about the K-Means Clustering algorithm. I'm now far more familiar with it than I was at the time, but this was my first interaction with the algorithm.

We were given the `zoo_2.txt` dataset, and the task was to run K-Mean Clustering using two distance measures: the typical Euclidean distance, and the Manhattan distance between pairs of points. Each of those clusterings was run 10 times, and the clusters were printed to the console.

The final conclusion was that the two distance algorithms trade blows, with neither one of them being definitively better than the other.
