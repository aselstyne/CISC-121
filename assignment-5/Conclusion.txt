In my tests, out of 600 trials, radix sort was faster than merge sort 100% of the time. 
It was on average 0.015 seconds faster than merge sort, which is about a 25% improvement.
If you increase the magnitude of the range we're dealing with, however, to [1,000,000, 9,999,999], then you find that merge sort 
wins about 33% percent of the time.
This suggests that because radix sort does significantly more work for each increase in the number of digits present, while it is faster
for lists of our magnitude, if you had a data set with larger numbers merge sort may be the better choice.
