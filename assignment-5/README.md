# Assignment 5 - Sorting Algorithms

The task in this assignment was to implement two sorting algorithms, and then determine which one was faster, on average. The first algorithm was not optional, Radix Sort, and for the second students were given a choice. I implemented Merge Sort.

Then, each algorithm was tested on 100 random listed of 100 random numbers, to measure how long it took to sort each one. Ultimately, the results were compiled in `Conclusion.txt`, and Radix Sort was faster 100% of the time.
